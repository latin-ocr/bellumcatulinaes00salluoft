xii INTROD UOTJON. ’

any Roman writer which would stand beside Thucy-
dides, It was his ambition to supply the want.

That could only be done by offering as complete
a contrast to the tedious annalist as possible, and
Sallust neglected no means of giving variety to 1115
work. From Thucydides 116 probably borrowed the
idea of his introductions, the imaginary speeches⁹‚
and the character portraits¹⁰ 3 from Cato the picturesque
descriptions of the scenes of 11151011631 61761115, and
the ethnographical digressions. And not only with
the help of such exterior decorations does Sallust
seek to excite interest, but in the handling of the
facts of history 116 15 31 pains to bring out the general
tendencies to which they point, to deduce from the

past the causes which have led to the incidents 116 ³

describes, to pourtray the moral condition of the
times, to assign the motives which guided the 361015 111
1116 (1131113.

With this abundant superstructure, it is not un-
natural that we have often to complain that 11151011631 y
truth and accuracy tend to fall too much in the back-
ground, and that Sallust is more of a rhetorician than
an historian. That‚ however, was not an objection

9 The speecheS‚ which in the Catiline take up almost a
quarter of the whole book, in the Jugurtha occupy not more
than a sixth. In the HistorieS, from which we have probably
all the speeches, the amount must have been still further
reduced.

¹⁰ The portraiture of character 15 perhaps Sallust’s strong-
651 point. The contrasted portraits of Cato and Caesar in the
Catiline have seemed to many writers, and not without reason,

to form what was intended to be the kernel of the work.
