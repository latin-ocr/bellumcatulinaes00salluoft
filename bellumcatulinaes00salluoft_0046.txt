dides is very noticeable in Sallust's writings, alike in· ;
matter and in form. His countrymen ventured to
pronounce Sallust equal if not superior to his Greek ἶ
- model, both as a writer and as an historian. To such ’ξ
a position Sallust has no claim, but to have been in
his turn a model for Tacitus is no slight merit⁷. ‘

Under this head I givea few examplcs of ELLIPSE. ’
In the omission of the parts of sum, Sallust is bolderl
than any writer except Tacitus. Est, sunt, erat, erant 3
are often omitted, whether used as copula or abso- ²
lutely, both in dependent and principal sentenceS‚
especially in descriptions of places, battles, and cha- ·
racters. There are instances also of omission of sum, ,
sumus, sit, fucrit, esset, fore. Esse is always omitted }¹
after putare, pati, videre and often after reri. When esse ..ᾗ

dered probable by the close resemblance of J. 60. 1-4 with,
Time. 7. 71, 2—4. Γ

7 Tacitus' familiarity with Sallust’s writings is shown by his
imitation of several phrases (Drager, S. u. S. des Tacitus, p. 125), ”
He calls Sallust ‘the most brilliant of Roman historiansss If
may add here a word as to Livy’s opinion of him, as it has to ’ἦ

Livius tam iniquus Sallustio suit‚’ that he criticized his phrase Ι
‘res secunda-e mire sunt vitiis optentur: (Or. Lep. 24) as an imi· ης
tation, and a bad imitation, of Thucydides’ (though by the⁴
way it is not Thucydides, but an inexact quotation from De· f
mosthenes) δειναὶ ’γὰρ αἱ εὐπραξίαι συγκρύψαι καὶ συσκιάσαι τὰ ·

Thucydides. If it be true, however, that Livy was not among
Sallust’s admirers, the difference of temperament of the twu Ἴ
writers would sufficiently explain the fact. Α
