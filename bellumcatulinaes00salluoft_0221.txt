—m 4] ,· Noms: v1⁴:29
route and· refers probably to the ascent of the street- in which

Α the carcer stood from the sorum, which agrees with existing

⁹ localities”. But it surely refers to how you are to find the
v ‘Tullianum’ when you have entered the carcer.

⁴ 5. vindices rerum capitalium] Mommsen (B. S. 1². 581.
'j n.) takes the v. r. c. to be the tresviri capitales mentioned above
ἕ (ep. Cic. de Legg. 3. 3. 6 vincula sonuum servante, capitalia
vindicante), and concludes that these Officers strangled Lentulus

ι, with their own hands. Is it possible that these dignifled chiese
j} os the police, who had concurrent authority with the aediles
¹ (Liv- 25. 1), who had ‘viatores' attending them in the streete,
ι- 'should have had to sink to be executioners? Mommsen main·

j taius that they had this disagreeable duty to perform only when
the criminals were men οἱ high position or women. The evidence
¹ (Val. Max. 5. 4. 7; Tac. A.·5. 9) seems somewhat insufficient.

, still, however that may be, the sreyere need not any more

imply that they did it themselves, than it is meant in 51. 29
³ that the Thirty Tyrants killed their victims with their own

'⁴ hands.

6. entium vitae] It is proposed (by F. Vogel) to alter
exitium to altum. For the phrase is not found elsewhere,
and indeed vitae is superfluous. And there are the following
apparent imitations of S. in Augustine (alionum moribus factis-
que suit exitum reperiunt), and in Hegesippus-a. constant

·; imitator—hic tali dianus exitu suit3 exitum vitae invenire;
' ita diynum meritis suis vitae exitum tulit. The MS authority

however for exitium is too strong, and the explanation of the
word probably is‘that it does not mean ‘miserable end ’, but
that exitium=exiturm Exilium antiqui ponebant pro exitum:
nune exitium pessimum exitum dicimus. Festus.

Ch. σο, 1. duas mones] the ordinary number for a
consul, which Catilius claimed to be. The regular number
ol a legion was 6000. There were 10 cohorts to the legion.
His cohorte then were at first only 100 men strong.

2. voluntarius aut ex sociis] The voluntarii are those
who were extra coniurationem (39. 5): with sociis supply con·
tumtunm.
= 8. pan quarta] ‘only a quarter’. So alii e. q. s. (below),

‘a {ew had only, eta? ’

4. adventabat] ‘was on the march’.

ad urbm'modo ln Galliam vorsus] Vornm is always ae-
eompauied by in or ad in Sallust, with one exception: J. 19. 8
quem locum Aeqyptum vomu finem imperi habuere Cartha-

, fluimus.
