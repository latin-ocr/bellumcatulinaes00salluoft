xxx REMARKS ΟΝ SALLUST’S STYLE.

person, Sallust uses the language of an unaffected ’
111311 of the world². 2

The ancients, then, were struck mainly by the
β archaisms 3 in the present day, however, it is con·
tended that 'Sallust’s partiality for CONVERSATIONAL
EXPREssmNs is quitc as marked. No ancient critic, I ”·
believe, notices this point, but ’that perhaps need not 23
excite surprise or incredulity. Many words and ex·
pressione, of course, tend to drop out of literature but ³
continue in the spoken language, so that the 31011310 1¹,

and conversational often coincide. But nevertheless η
11013 only does Sallust use not a· few words and ex· ’

pressions, archaic from the point of view of literature,
which happened to be also part of the every-day speech
of the time, but many words and turns, which have ’
001116 direct from conversational language³. So much
may be taken as fairly established. But when Wolf· .
fiin describes Sallust’s style shortly as ‘vulgar demo-
crat's Latin ²—that gives an'exaggerated idea of the
prevalence of colloquialisms in Sallust. Jordan once ·

more strongly denies the justice of this description ,

² The reader may be reminded of: -ere for -erzmt, suppli-
cia=supplicationes, perditum ire, hostem ferire from the C. not
in speeches, but see the notes passim. Jordan gives no evi-
dence except that according to him the forms—colos, odos,
labos—were employed only in speeches‚ 31111 1311313 actutum, his
conjecture in J. 102. 14, occurs in an indirect report of 3
speech. J ordan's language, which I quote, gives on the other
hand 3 rather exaggerated .idea of the archaic 130116 of the
speecheS.

3 As samples may 116 taken: perqnaras, which occurs only

, 111 S. and Apuleius, portatio in S. 31111 Vitruvius. Populares

(='socii) must come‘rather from the sermo plebeius than the ¹
s. cotidianus. “
