xxxvi REMA ΗΚΒ off SALLUSPS smne(

Α To these may be added a few from the HistorieS. ’ ⁶,
Auxisse, Or. Phil. 6 intransitive. Gellius quotes Cato, ,
eo res eorum auait. F orus :forum (illumforum), and·
— vadus = vadum. (facilem vadum). ObsequeZa—-per obse· ;

quelam orationis. Caesar B. G. 7. 29. 4 uses obse-
quentia instead. Other colloquial words of this termi- ‹

nation are custodela, cautela, suyela, suadela, turbela.
Percupiclus, also in Cicero's letters. Potior with accu-

sative (cuncta potiundi), so vescor (insolita vescen- ·

tibus). Privus = without, privos militiae—the word l
occurs besides only in Apuleius in this sense, p. verae V
rationis. Quaesoz Classical prose uses only the forms ’ ζ,
‘ quaeso’, ‘ quaesumus’, and these parenthetically. Sal-

lust, however, besides the passages quoted in the note, ⁷

p. 142, has in the fragments—Curionem quaesit ut ,

concederet, and Ep. Mith. 1 quod quaesitum satisne

pium sit. The word, however, is rather solemn and
formal than archaic or colloquial, according to J ordan.

 

Senectus, an adjective, senecto corpore and senecta iam s

aetate, as in Plautus and Lucretius. Soluerat = solitus ,ἶ
erat. Vis = vires acc.-—so Lucretius„

artfficem. Quintilian speaks of immortalem illam Sallustii :

velocitatem. Seneca, the elder, thinks he surpassed Thucy·

dides himself in brevity. Seneca, the younger, says Sallustio l

viyente amputatae sententiae et verba ante exspectatum caden-
tia et obscura brevitas suere pro cultu.
