11111 familiarum] So in the only other place where the,
expression is used 51. 9 matres familiarum. Varro says si
analogias sequi vellent, plures patres familias dicere non de-'
buerunt, sed ut Sisenna scribit, patres familiarum. Sallust
imitated Sisenna, Tacitus Sallust (A. 1. 26, 3, 8 Tiberius...'
iuvenem sueta crya filios familiarum nobiles liberalitate auget,
11. 13 le9e lata saevitiam creditorum coercuit, ne in mortem'
parent-um pecunias filiis familiarum foenori darent). All other
writers from Terence to Quintilian prefer the other forms·
patres (etc.) familias—As regards the rights of the father over
the son’s property—rights which were always exercised without
scruple to the full extent to which they were sanctioned by
law, see Maine‚ Anc. Law p. 141 ff. Poste's Gaius p. 64. The
proprietary privileges of the parent were not curtailed in any.
way till the time of Augustus. The oppressive action of the
patria potestas in depriving the sons of all power of holding
property except at the will of their fathers would explain the'
eagerness of some of the filii familiarum to kill their fathers. ’

3. dies prolatando] prolatare is rather a favourite word of -
Sallust’s, but he never uses it except here with an object ex-
pressing time. Eussner therefore proposes to read in dies pro-2
latando cp. Ep. Mithr. 12 pretio in dies bellum prolatam. But
dies means ‘arrangements'‚ ‘fixtures'‚ and cp. Tac. A. 6. 42
diem ex die prolatabant.

5. ,quis sim] Cic. in Cat. 3. 5. 12 gives the letter to the
same effect, but in different words. Erant autem sine no-
mine, sed ita: Quis sim, scies ex hoc quem ad te misi. Cura
ut vir sis et coyita quem in locum sis proyressus: vide, quid
iam tibi sit necesse, et cura ut omnium tibi auxilia adiungyas,
etiam infimorum. Which, if either, is the exact version?
Dietsch truly remarks that Cicero does not pretend to be
reading from a copy, but quoting apparently from memory
(erant)g, while Sallust' s words imply that he is giving us the
original. On the other hand Halm no less truly says that Sall.
