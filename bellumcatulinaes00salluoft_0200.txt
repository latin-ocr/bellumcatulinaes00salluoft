133 ΒΑΜ, Usr’s CATJLJNE. [1. ι’

Catulus the princeps senatus. Plutarch (Cic. 21, Gaea 8) must
be wrong in putting Catulus' spe ech after that of Caesar and

1 perhaps after Cato' s, but it may be that the Catulus of whom

he speaks 1s a son. [The custom of calling upon the consuls-
designate first for their opinion would apply of course only to
the latter half of the year. The old rule that at other times
the princeps senatus should first be appealed to was at this
time often departed from by a presiding consul who wished to
do honour to any consular. Cicero (ad Att. 1. 13. 2) complains
in Jan. 693 (61) that the consul preferred his brother the
pacificatorem Allobrogum to him, but consoles himself by
the reflection—ille secundas in dicendo loeus habet auctori-
tatem paene principis et voluntatem ‘non nimis devinctam
beneficio consulis. It was usual however for the president to
adhere to the order which he adopted on the lst J an. through· ³
out the year.]

111 custodiis] i.e. in libera custodia in different houses.

P. Furio] has not been mentioned by S. before: cp. Cic. in
Cat. 3. 6. 14 P. Furium, qui est de eis colonis, quos Faesulas
L. Sulla deduxit. He is perhaps then the Faesulanum
quendam (59. 3) who commanded the left wing of Catiline's
army at Pistoria.

supplicium sumundum] He afterwards explained his
words away. Suetonius (Jul. 14) says that the effect of
Caesar’ s speech was such, ut D. Silanum consulem de. iynatum
‘non piguerit sententiam suam, quia matare turpe erat, inter· ,
pretatione lenire, velut gyravius atque ipse sensisset eoeceptam.
Plut. Cic. 21 ὥστε καὶ τὸν Σιλανὸν αὖθις μεταβαλόμενον παραι-
τεῖσθαι καὶ >xe‘7ecv2⁸ ὡς οὐδ’ αὐτὸς εἴποι θανατικὴν γνώμην, ἐσχάτην
γὰρ ἀνδρὶ βουλευτῇ Ρωμαίων εἶναι δίκην το δεσμωτήριον.

decreverat] Sallust‘ s favourite use of the pluperfect comes
in very awkwardly here—not before the turn came to Caesar,
but, as dixerat and censuerat below, before the division. These
pluperfects led Appian to suppose that Nero spoke before Caesar„
but that does not seem to have been the case, see beIOW.

pedibus 111 sententiam Ti. Neronis iturum se dixerat] (It
was allowable‚ then, for a previous speaker to rise again to
give a short explanation.) Silanus said that he would vote for
Nero’s proposal‚ when the time came for a division. The
presiding magistrate (one of the conquS‚ or, in their absence,
>the praetor urbanus) then gave out Qui hoc censetis, illue
transite ,· qui alia omnia, in hane partem, and, after counting
the numbers, Haec pars maior videtur, unless the senators
were unanimous (sine ulla varietate). [It has been questioned
whether, when there was a perroyatio, there was also a division¹
