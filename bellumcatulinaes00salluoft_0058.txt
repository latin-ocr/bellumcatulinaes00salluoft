Besides the MSS„ the earliest of which belongs pern ι
haps to the 9th century, we have earlier help toward ¹1
the determination of the text in the quotations b ·· ‘
grammarians and scholiasts, by the Fathers and othe ·
writers; and hints may now and then be gleaned frow

particular, are not muchlto be relied on, unless they ἰ
quote especially for the word or construction in ques· ,ὲ
