-136 SALL UST'S CATILINE. [XLIX. 2 .

competitores multumque et aetate et almitate· antecedentes '

superavit, ut plura ipse in eorum tribubus suffrayia quam ἀἰετέ
que in omuibus tulerit. Q. Lutatius Catulus was consul 676
(78), censor 689 (65), and (Vell. 2. 43) omnium confessione prin-
ceps senatus. Catulus probably was getting on for 60, Caesar
was born in 654 (100) or more probably acc. to Mommsen in
652 (102), and was therefore 37 or 39. The expressions ex-
trema aetate and adulescentulo are therefore much exaggerated
—by the disappointed Catulus.

3. res autem opportuna videbatur] ‘The state of Caesar-’s
affair...to their pmject’, or ‘their project (of getting Caesar sus·
pected) seemed favoured by circumstances '. ο

privatim—publice] go with e. liberalitate and m. muneribus
respectively, and not with debebat. His debts amounted to 1300
talents before he filled any office. Plut. Caes. 5. His extrava-
gant shows, as curule aedile, much increased them. ·

4. ementiundo] ‘lying roundly'.

dicerent] i.e. quae, ut dicebant, audissent. Cic. Verr. 5. 7.
17 nominat iste servum quem mayistrum pecoris esse diceret;
eum dicit coniurasse. Cic. Phil. 2. 4. 7 at etiam litteras quas
me sibi misisse diceret, recitavit (cp. 30. 1. Saenius—litteras
recitavit, quas Faesulas adlatas sibi dicebat).

conflaverant] with reference to the following usque adeo
e. q. s.

egredienti] from the sitting 5 Dec. It was in fact his speech
on that occasion which excited the wrath of the equites. Ex
senatu, this is the only place in which S. uses eyredior with the
prep. ex: elsewhere it takes the simple ablative.

Ch. 50,1. dum haecin senatu aguntur] S. returns quite ⁴J
unconcernedly (and awkwardly, conffldermg the preceding 1

words egredienti ex senatu) to 48. 6.

praem-ia] Cic. in Cat. 4. 3. 5 says praemia amplissima. ἶ

What the ambassadors got is not known. As to Volturcius
see 30. 6. The AHobroges‚ at any rate, did not get their
‚grievances redressed‚ and revolted next year.

liberti] not libertini because liberti Lentuli. In reference
to his manumitter a freedman is called libertus not libertinus.

opifices atque servitia] See Cic. in Cat. 4. 8 (ξ 17 auditum
est, lenonem quendam Lentuli concursare circum tabernas

e· qpssm] when in a sentence that has two members the
partim etc. is put only with the second member, the partim
denotes the smaller number (Kritz). J. 31. 10 incedunt per ora
