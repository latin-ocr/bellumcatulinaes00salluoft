xxixii REMARKS ΟΝ SALLUSPS STYLE.

Oato, and· he wrote with effort and elaboration3 but¹ Γ
his style is still the expression of the writer's cha·
racter, direct, incisive, emphatic and outspoken, averse ,ᾖ
, from qualifying refinements or intricacy of any kind⁴. ‘5

Whether it be true, as is often maintained, that
the peculiarities of his style grew upon Sallust, that ³
in his Histories he indulged more often in archaisms
and in bold and unusual constructionS, is far from·
certain. Indeed the opposite is sometimes assertecl.· ,
The fact is that we are hardly able to judge. The· ³
only complete remains of this work are the speeches,
and we cannot, for the reason already mentioned, ⁹
take these as representative of the whole book. The
detached fragments are preserved mainly by gram· ἕ
marians, and are quoted not always with accuracy for
some singularity of grammar. The style, however, of 1
the Catiline and J ugurtha offers a few contrasts:—

⁴ Some writers (especially Poppo) have maintained that j
Sallust’s style is largely affected by imitation of Greek con-f
structionS, taken principally from Thucydides, There has
however been much exaggeration in the matter. The following
nevertheless may be reasonably regarded as of Greek origin:

The construction does not appear to occur in Latin before
Sallust. Livy has it once 21. 50. 10, and sl'acitus thrice.—J..
73. 5 in maius celebrare seems to come from Thuc. 1. 21. 1 ἐπὶ
τὸ μεῖζον xoafiaeofivres.—Quintilian (9. 3. 17) quotes vulqus amat
fieri as one of Sallust’s imitations of Greek phrases, probably ⁴
an inexact quotation of J. 34. 1.-1n J. 84. 1, multus atque J
ferox instare, cp. Thuc. 4. 22 πολὺς ἐνέκειτο, though this ad· ’
verbial use of multus is not rare in early Latin.
