not the truth. One is not inclined to think so 111 of
him, 011 the one hand, as to believe that he would
willingly have falsified history to that extent, nor so
· well of him, on the other, as to think, although he
had without question a sincere feeling of admiration
for Caesar, that his critical and censorious nature
would have allowed him to give way to such generous
partizanship. Nor is there any reason to suppose
that Sallust was in any way behind the soenes, or
that he was aware of the occult connexion which,
as it is now supposed, Caesar had with the earlier
at least of these transactions. He had heard of course
the suspicions and charges that were rife‚ but 116,
with his prepossessionS, is not likely to have credited
what was said by Caesar’s enemies.

On what sources besides his memory did Sallust
rely2 From himself we hear nothing except that
he had one remark from Crassus' own lips. No
doubt Sallust must have read the writings of Cicero
that bore on the subject, but it 15 very doubtful
whether he had them before him as 116 wrote. It is ξ’
true that one or two phrases remind one of something .
very like them in Cicero, but these may well be only
echoes easily explained by the literary celebrity of
Cicero's speeches. Some 611015 111 Sallust's account
at any rate can hardly have been made if he had

Caesar's death, for Plutarch (Crass. 13) says ὁ Κικέρων ἔν τινι .
λόγῳ φανερὸς ἦν Κράσσῳ καὶ Καίσαρι τήν αἰτίαν προστριβόμενος,
ἀλλ’ οὗτος ὁ λόγος ἐξεδόθη μετὰ τὴν ἀμφοῖν τελευτήν. (Ρ. 15
