OWING probably to the favour with which the <-
Fathers (especially St Augustine) regarded Sallust's η
writings, we have an exceptionally large number of ,
manuscripts, about fisty, I believe. A start was first Ι
made in determining in a methodical way the relative '
value of this mass of manuscripts by O. L. Roth 111
1854. Some of the MSS. have a gap of several Chapters „⁸
towards the end of the J ugurtha. 'Taking this, and
some other slighter omissionS‚ for his criteria, Roth '34
divided the MSS. into three classes, thus 2—1. Those ,ζ’
which omit J. 103. 2 after necessariorum to J. 112. 3,-
where they resume with pacem vellet. II. Those which
have this matter. III. Those which, besides 131161
filling in of this large lacuna, have certain other sen· ⁴
tences, omitted by both the preceding classes. These 4
are J. 44. 5 sed neque ‘muniebantur ea... (though 13116 ,;
words vary much), J. 21. 4 de controversiis suis iure =
potius quam bello disceptare, and G. 6. 2 ita...erat ὶῖ
(01· est). ·.1
The MSS. of the first, and of course oldest class, {f
belong to the 101311 century, those of the second 13·
1116 11111 ; while those of the third belong to the 14th,' , Ᾰ
and are therefore of not much account ⁸. ³

the order of words. In an Ashburnham MS. which I have 4'
