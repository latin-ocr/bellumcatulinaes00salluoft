96 SALLUSPS CA TJLJNE. [xvm. 31?

 

, As to what were the rights of the consul-in refusing an in· l
tendmg candidate’s name authorlties are divided. Lange main- ’,1
tains that an impending criminal prosecution in itself debarrea ιζ

μ a candidate. Mommsen is of opinion that the matter was en- *⁴

tirely in the discretion of the consul, though that ‘Pullus'> refusal Ῐ
on this occasion was a rather unusual, if not high-handed j?
proceeding. Perhaps however Dr John’s middle position is² ὃ
nearer the truth—that if the prosecution had got so far as the fl}
sortitio iudicum a man was necessarily excluded. In the case 5]
of Scaurus the prosecution do not avail themselves of an in- ἰ
terval of 30 days allowed them to collect evidence in Sardinia.
so that the trial may get on far enough to prevent Scaurus τ
standing for the consulship (Ascon. Arg. of Cic.’s speech).'
The same with the case of Clodius and Milo: the aim was that
Cic. ad Q. f. 2. 1. 2 sortitione iudicum facta comitia haberentur.

 

It is very doubtful whether S. is right in representing theg j
plot to have been to make Catiline one of the consuls, instead ¹
of Sulla. In his defence of Sulla, Cicero of course declares 3
that it was Catiline who was to be consul; but it is curious ,
that in the copious list of Catiline's offences in the Or. in to'g. ᾗ
cand. and in Asconius’ comments nothing is said of such an· ¹
attempt on Catiline’s part, though the projected slaughter of ἶ
the senate is mentioned. Other authorities too—Livy’s Epito{
mator, Suetonius, Cassius Dio—make the plot to have been tq =
restore the ,unseated consuls by force. Catiline’s part in this· ,
first conspiracy was probably a very subordinate one, and its ἓ
real directors Crassus and Caesar. Even Sallust seems to ἶ
disconnect this plot with Catiline's true conspiracy in the' ³
parenthetical way in which he introduces his notice of it. §j
(What evidence there is will be found Cic. p. Suu. 24. 67, Liv. l}
Ep. 101, Suet. Jul. 8.) ᾖ]

6. ea re cognita] ‘as the plot got to be known ’. The Ξ
logical subject of the abl. abs. is not here, as it should be, the
subject of the sentence. Cp. J. 10. 1 parvom eqo, Iugurtha, te {¹

meaning, Dietsch holds that as the text stands Sallust’s l}
account is absurd. Is it conceivable‚ he asks, that no publio ἒ
action should have been taken, and the conspirators have had 1
only to postpone the execution for a month? Cassius Dio 36. Ι
27 says that-the new consuls being warned of some danger
provided themselves with a guard, and that that prevented the
execution of the design. Probably S. said the same, but it has
dropped out. He marks a lacuna therefore before ea re, and
the filling up would be-‘the consuls, wamed of some danger
determined to provide themselves with an armed escort ’. But
