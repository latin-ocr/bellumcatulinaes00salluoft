110 SALL UST’S CA TILINE. [xxvn. 4

stanee of its use in Or. Obl. in the relative sentences, which
cannot but be regarded as parts of the speech: C. 14. 7 ecio
fuisse nonnullos qui ita existumarent, iuventutem, quae domum
Catilinae frequentabat, parum honeste pudicitiam habuisset
C. 50. 3 convocato senatu refert quid de eis fieri placeat, qui in
custodiam traditi eraut. Cp. also C. 22. 3, 30. 6, 50. 4, 51. 32,
and 43, J. 38. 9 quurtha...verba facit: tametsi ipsum...clau·:
sum tenet (so P, but Jordan teneret), tamen se...missurum.· 54. ι
1 hortatur acl cetera quae levia sunt parem animum gerant(
(here sunt because q. levia sunt is only a periphrasis for levia)3
and many others.

Ch. 28, 1. cornelius] was certainly one. See Cio. p. Suu.
18. 52. (Appian B. C. 2. 2 and Plut. Cic. 16 confuse him
with O. Cornelius Cethegus, when they mention Cethegus as
one of the two.)

, Vargunteius senator] Cic. in Cat. 1. 4. 9 talks of duo
equites. Perhaps V. had lost his place in the senate in eonse-
quenee of the trial de ambitu (Cic. p. Sull. 2. 6). Appian gives “
Lentulus, Plutarch Marcius as the other. Cio. p, Suu. 6. 18
says that Autronius set Cornelius on. ¹

eum armatis· hominibus] Can S. be right about this P·
Would the two conspirators have made their ‘ morning-eall' with ²
attendants, and armed attendants? The other authorities say
nothing of this. Appian B. C. 2. 3 Λέντλῳ δὲ καὶ τοῖς συνωμο-
ταις ἔδοξεν...Λέ-ντλον μὲν αὐτὸν καὶ Κέθηγον ἐφεδρεῦσαι ra&
Κικέρωνος θύραις περὶ ἕω μετὰ κεκρυμμένων ξιφιδίων, ἐσδεχθέντας,
τε διὰ τὴν ἀξίωσιν καὶ λαλοῦντας ὁτιδὴ μηκῦναι τὴν ὁμιλίαν ἐν περι-
πάτῳ καὶ κτεῖναι περισπάσαντας ἀπὸ τῶν ἄλλων. Plut. Cio. 16,¹
Dio 37. 32. Hagen supposes that here (as also in 18. 3) Sall„
intent upon writing quam verissume (4. 3), wrote down what he
found in his authorities in spite of the improbability. Dietseh‘
marks a lacuna after hominibus, for he is eonvinced that S..
must at least have added what he supposed these men were
for. Sallust's idea may have been that the armed men were to
be kept in reserve to shield the murderers afterwards, or tu·
force an entry if necessary. Certainly Cicero's precautions (i '
Cat. 1. 4. 10 domum meam maioribus praesidiis munivi atq Ι
firmavi) were rather extravagant as against two men only. ι

Samnium, and Lucania. ¹

c Ch. 29, 1. long-lus] only here of time in S„ but often '
aesar.

exagitatam] Exaaitari is never used in S. in the sen
