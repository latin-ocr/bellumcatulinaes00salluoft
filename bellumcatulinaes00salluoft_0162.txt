100 SALL UST'S CATILI NE. [xx. ’ἲ

first member as i'n the second? Perhaps then Aurelius Victor ἱ
gives us what S. wrote in his phrase ‘immissique in imperium ·'

promiscue boni malique nobiles atqueiynobiles' (cp. J. 67. 2

iuxta boni malique strenui et inbelles), though P may be right ὲ
’ in leaving out the que (cp. O. 51. 9 armis cadaveribus, cruore {
atque luctu). The strenui then will be an old gloss to boni. ’
In this instance however must not P be defended against its ἱ
champion? Would S. make Catiline admit in his impassioned ;

address that any of his party were mali?
fuimus] ‘have become ’.

8. pericula repulsas] eyestatem obviously answers to divi·
tiae, and perhaps ‘repulsas to honos, but the words are not
chosen or arranged to correspond precisely. Pericula in the
sense of ‘ criminal charges’ is common.

9. quae quousquetandem] cp. Cic. in Cat. 1 (ad init.)
Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra?

inhonestam] i. e. non honestatam honore, 35. 3.
in manu vobis] cp. J. 14. 13 nos uti per otium tuti simus

in vostra manu est. J. 31. 5 id frustra an ob rem faciam in ⁸

vostra manu situm est: so here ‘to gain the victory depende
on you’. Jordan doubts whether the reading of the >inferior
MSS in manibus be not the true one, and indeed the sense

required is rather ‘ victory is within our grasp '. S. is fond of

repeating a phrase that occurs to him: cp. dominatio in ma·
nibus above. In manu is used for ‘ to have at one’s disposal',
51. 36: ‘to be able to control ', J. 14. 4: and in manibus in a

more literal sense in J. 73. 6 opifices ayrestesque omnes, quorum ¹

'res fidesque in manibus sitae erant.

10. viget aetas, animus valet] Cic. Mil. 31. 85 vestrae
reliyiones viquerunt, vestra vis valuit. Ca-tiline's followers have
the lusty bodily vigour of youth, and are in full possession
of their mental powers, J. 11. 5 confectum annis Micipsam
parum animo valuisse.

divitus] the luxuries which wealth supplies serve but to
debilitate the strength.

consenuerunt] with S. -ere is the rule, -erunt the exception.
In the Catiline there are only four instances of the longer
form: dixerunt 51. 9, sumpserunt 51. 38, venerunt 45. 3. The
form in -erunt is however the accepted literary form. “ The
shorter conver-sational -ere is less common even in Plautus

“ and Terence than the other, andis extremely rare in Cicero

(see Or. 47. 157 nec vero reprehenderim: scripsere alii rem;
