collation of the two or three of the oldest MSS. was( ³
far from correct. At the present time, not all the3}
MSS. of the first class have been collated 3 but J οτόῑειῐιξἓ

most importance. The chief result at which he hasgl
arrived is, that the oldest MS. we have is also the best,{
that it' is the main foundation on which the text must}>
be built⁹. The accuracy of the recension of this MS.,}
which Jordan gave out in 1866, has, in all material?
points, been abundantly established by Wirz, who had v}
