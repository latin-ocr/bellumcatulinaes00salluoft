nialos praemiasecuntur, id. 21 fortuna meliores sequitur. A
personal object is always put, so that the illum of the text, and
not Dietsch’s illa must be right. For ⁴the change of subject cp.

⁷ J. 14. 16 si omnia quae aut amisi aut ex necessariis advorsa

facta sunt. 101. 5 cum peditibus, quos Volux adduxerat
neque in priore puqna itinere morati adfuerant.

Ch. 55, 1. in catonis sententiam discessit] i.e. voted in
favour of Cato's proposal.

ratus] ‘thinking '. Ratus, from Sallust onward, served as a
substitute for the wanting present participle of reor. Cp. J. 69.
1 Vagenses ubi animum advortere *ad se vorsum exercitum
peryere, primo, uti erat res, Metellum esse rati, portas clausere,
deinde...rursum Iuyurtham arbitrati cum magyno glaudio obvii
procedunt. - Many other past participles of deponents are used
aoristically‚ without it being implied that the action they ex-
press precedes that of the principal verb. Cp. arbitrati in the
above quotation, and veritus in J. 15. 5 veritus...ne polluta
licentia invidiam accenderet, animum a consueta lubidine con-
tinuit. There is a somewhat similar use of the present partici-
ple in J. 113. 1 haec Maurus secum ipse diu volvens tandem pro-
misit, and J. 35. 10 sed postquam Roma egressus est, fertur
saepe eo tacitus respiciens postremo dixisse e.q.s.

antecapere] J. 21. 3 maxime festinans tempus lecatorum

antecapere. Cicero would write antevertere or praevertere for
antecapere.

triumviros] The tresviri capitales.

’ quae [ad] supplicium postulabat] As to ad Dietsch says
‘cum defendi posse videatur, nolo suspiciones sequi '. Is it
possible that consul can be the subject to postulabat? ³

2. ceteris] Cp. 52. 25.

3. Tullianum] is described in Burn’s Rome and the
Campayna (p. 81) and in Mommsen. It was originally a well-
house, as the name denotes, and there is still a spring in it
(hence Jugurtha's exclamation). “It was roofed by layers of
peperino-stone so placed that each overlaps the layers beneath'’‚
Burn— (that is described by Sall. camera lapideis fornicibus
iuncta). At a later time another vaulted chamber was built 1
over it, aud the stone which closed the vaulted roos of the ’
lower chamber removed—hence demissus. Ubi paululum ascen-
deris ad laevam is far from clear. If Jordan, the leading
‘authority on Roman topography, is undecided between ascen-
deris and descenderis, who is to decide? Merivale says, “The
phrase ubi ascenderis seems to imply some common passenger’s
