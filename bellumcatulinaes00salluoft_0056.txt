xlviii NOTE'S ΟΝ THE MANUSG‘RIPTS

The mistakes of the MS: 1³¹ (to be mentioned below) ⁷
are of a similar character, and they suggest perhaps
certain conclusions as to the character of the MS. from Α ’
- which they both come. In that MS. it would seem ‚
words were not divided from one another, and abbre- ’ ι
viations were often used for the terminations of Ἰ
verbs and nouns and also for middle syllables¹². It ⁸*
may be added that the constant mistakes between ’
a and u, and sometimes between f and s, show that ὲ
the original was in cursive character.

Another important and peculiar MS. is preserved “ ἶ
in the Vatican Library at Rome—Vaticanus 3864 (V) ’
It is of about the same date as P. Of Sallust it con- ’
tains the speeches and letters from the Catiline and *vg
‚J ugurtha, four speeches and two letters from the ¹ .'
Histories¹³, and also a speech and letter ‘ ad Caesarem
senem cle republicaJ—both of them undoubtedly spu· =
rious. The corrector of P agrees with V in the parts ρ
they have in common, and perhaps this second hand J·
(p) took these corrections from V. The variations ,
between P and V are mainly in the order of the .⁴
words3 and, while in the genuine vspeeches V gives  
a later spelling (optimus melyas vult eta), in the
speech and letter to Caesar we find e. 9. I clei, iqnarei,

1² Ι gratefully acknowledge here my obligations to P. Klim-
scha's Sallustianische Miscellen. 1882. He is of opinion that ,ς
such mistakes as mayorum (maiorum), ayebat (aiebat), ’νερὶ ξ
(rei), yemebat (hiemabat) point to some parts at least having «
been dictated. · ,

13 Has V preserved all the speeches of the Histories? J 01·- ⁷'⁵
dan thinks so. The number seems small, but the ethnogra- '3
phical discussions and geographical descriptions would supply j:
a good deal of ornamentation.
