afterwards followed Caesar to Africa, and apparently
did good service there, for he was left in 708 in the
new province as proconsul. Sallust returned from
Africa in the next year, a very rich man, and built
himself the house and laid out the celebrated gardens,
where in after *years emperors resided. After the
murder of Caesar, Sallust, now 42 years of age, de-
termined to abandon politics altogether and to return
to the dream of his youth—literature. His first work
was the Oatiline (published in 712 ?)²; the Juyurtha

often no doubt loosely quoted. The only complete extant
fragments are four speeches and two letters :—1. A speech of
M. Aemilius Lepidus (father of the triumvir) ‘ad populum Ro-

of L. Marcus Philippus ad senatum in 677, against the above
Lepidus. 3. A speech of C. Aurelius Cotta ad populum in
679—to quiet the people. 4. A speech of C. Licinius Macer tr.
pl. ad plebem in 681. 5. Α letter of Pompeius ad senatum
in 679 from Spain. 6. A letter of king Mithridates to king
Arsaces in 685.

connect his 'political 'hostility to Milo with a private scandal.
