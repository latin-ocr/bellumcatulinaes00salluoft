114· SALLUST'S CA'TILINE. [XXXI. 3

Βαῖρτωε. atque delicus omissis] J. 41. 3 lascivia atque
super za.

5. sicut 1urg10 lacessitus foret] Jordan refers for the

* use of sicut to 38. 3, 53. 5: and Fabri (who reads however et

ut for aut sui above) takes the clause to refer to the prosecution
of Paullus, and explains the meaning to be that Catiline ,
wished by his presence to create the impression that he re· ἰ
garded this prosecution merely as an attempt to annoy him by
a malicious attack on his honour. But sicut comes only from
C, and the sense Ι think requires one of the coniectures si,
sicubi (= siforte—that word however does not occur in S„ though
it is unnecessarily conjectured in J. 60. 4), or si cuius :—At last
either to dissemble (his very presence in the senate would do'
that) or to clearnhimselss should he be provoked by taunts from
any quarter‚ he attended the meeting of the senate. ·

6. praesentiam eius timens] Cic. in Cat. 1. 5. 10 magno·
Zesivcnetu liberabis, dum modo iuter me atque te murus iu- ³

luculentam] ‘brilliant ' or ‘splendid '. cicero applies the ⁴
same epithet to Gato's speech on 5th Dec„ ad Att. 12. 21. 1 cur ,’
erqo in sententiam Catonis? quia verbis luculentioribus et ⁴
pluribus rem eandem comprehenderat: where it means only ¹
‘perspicuous', ‘ distinct ', ‘outspoken’. ’ ³

postea scriptam edidit] consequently, it is implied‚ Ι καθιεᾶ.ν
say nothing of 1t. It was pubhshed m 694 (60) accordmg to'

7. ut erat paratus ad] J. 7. 4 Ιαῃῑιντῆα ut erat inpiyro ἰ
atque acri iugenio. Paratus is generally constructed with inf„¹ ¹
but once (J. 91. 2) with ut, and with ad here only.

ea. familia ortum] ortus only here in S. with simple abla-·
tive‚ elsewhere with ex. Cicero’s construction with ab does not⁴
occur. The fact that ex is used in all writers with orior
in speaking of the source of streams fixes the metaphor
perhaps in the common expressions, C. 6. 3 invidia ex walen-⁴· ἰ
tia orta est, etc. - · ’

omnia bona in spe haberet] eie. ad Att. 11. 19. 1 quoa*
nulla equidem habeo iu spe. Omnia: ‘ nothing but ’. Cic. Ep.
5. 10 (a) sed tamen omnia mihi dura imperas. ·

plebem Romanam] Should populum Romanum be read·
here with Dietsch and Schmalz ? But it is difficult to suppose-⁵ ‘
that if the archetype of P had P. R. the writer can have inter-·
preted that plebem B. ‚The plebem is not out of place in'
