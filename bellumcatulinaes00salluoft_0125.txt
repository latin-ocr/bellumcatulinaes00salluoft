Tar Tim or rin Woaz—What did Sallust call the monos
ph? For the title which it bears at the present day, de coniu-
‚.·, Catilinae (taken from C. 4. 3), there is no authority.
υ· - grammarians describe the work in a variety of ways, but
- -.. in this. Priscian writes (always 1 believe) in Catilinario
-bello), Nonius in Catilinae bello, and elsewhere we find in
› ¹ ' nae historia, and the convenient in Catilina is often used.
⁸ · best MS (P) calls the book at the beginning bellum Catuli·
,and at the end bellum Catilinae. There is little doubt,
. but that the word Bellum came into it. Wo'lfflin says
In contrast to Cicero, who liked to describe the movement as
civilis coniuratio (Ep. 5. 12. 2 quoted in.note to 4. 2 carp·
), the historiari laid stress on the designation bellum, as a
·· :a against Cicero‘ s verse, Cedant arma toqae concedat
¹ eamdem. Was it then Bellum Catilinarium or Bellum Cati·
· · ἲ Probably the latter. Quintilian (3. 8. 9) describes the
Α ·works thus—in bello Iugurthino et Catilinae. And Florus,
·took his account from Sallust (see note on 61. 2), calls his⁹
· a on the conspiracy Bellum Catilinae. The adjective
·narim1niactdoesnot seemtooccur tillPriscian, a
· :ol Constantinople, ventured on it. (Catilinarum' is the
reading in Cic. in Cat. 2. 10. 23· and Pliny the elder wrote
’ πωπω.) It was avoided, as Wolfflin thinks, because of
-double meaning of which it is capable (see note on 5.1).
