severely moral tone of his writingS. What right has
he, contemporaries may be excused for asking, now
that he has taken refuge in his luxurious palaoe, built
on the oppression of the provincials, to seourge the
private and public vices of the times'l

Something of a consciousness that he was inviting
such a retort, of a feeling that he could not say of
himself what he puts into the mouth of Cato—qui
mihi atque animo ‘meo nullius umquam delicti qratiam

fecissem, haud ficeile alterius lubidini malefacta con-
donabam—seems at times to show itself in the hard,
sarcastic tone of his writing, a tone rather of violent ¹
irritability *and‘ disappointment than of genuine moral
indignation.

The large infusion of moral reflections and judg-
ments, however, from another and juster point of
view, is a very important element in Sallust's work.
Such moral refleotions were necessary material to a

Cp. Plato Orit..5l c. and Cic. Ep. 1. 9. Jordan observes that
we ean no more draw any exact conclusions as to Sallust’s
antecedents from under the veil which he thus throws over
them, than we ean infer from Horace’s relicta 'non bene par-
mula anything but that he shared the rout of a defeated
army. The two cases are not however quite parallel: the

point of Horaee’s phrase lies in its being a reminiscenee of
Alcaeum that S. would have borrowed from this letter unless it

had. fitted his own ease exaetly is doubtful. It must be no-
tieed that the ἓ 5 of the 3rd chapter is original in Sallust.
