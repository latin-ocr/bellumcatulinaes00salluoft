146 SALLUST’S CATILINE. ·, [mdia

tiones perpetuae ‘indirectly abolished the death 'penalty alto«
gether (see Maine's Ancient Law, ch. 10), for they could inflict
no more ‚than outlawry (aquae et iynis interdicam-practi-
cally, that is, exile. It is to this practieal abolition of the
death penalty that Caesar alludes in the following words—al
aliae le9e8...eoeilium permitti iubent, and in ξ 40. That Sal.
lust is right in not making Caesar allude to the lex Sempronia
(by name at any rate), however apposite it may be to the pre·
sent occasion, is not improbable. The l. Porcia was, so fal
as it coneerned scourging‚ a law of generally recognized validq
ity, while the l. Sempronia was extremely unpalatable tu
the senate3 and more than that, Caesar by his presence and
proposal laid himself open to the charge that he was infringing
that law: cp. Cic. in Cat. 4. 5. 10 Video de istis, qui se popu·
lares haberi volunt, abesse non neminem, ne de capite videlicet
civium. Romanorum sententiam ferat...At vero G. Caesar intel-
leyit, legem Semproniam esse de civibus Romanis constitutam¹
qui autem reipublicae sit hostis eum civem nullo modo esse
posse ,· denique ipsum latorem Semproniae leffl's iniussu populi
poenas ‘rei publicae dependisse. (6 The argument of Cicero, that
the men were hostes not cives, was a mere evasion3 for thei:
true character had only been prejudged hythe senatus consul«
tum ultimum, the constitutional validity of which had been
recently called in question in the case of Rabirius, which was
a moral defeat for the senate ’. Heitland's edition of the p.

Rabirio, p. 112, where a full discussion of the leyee Porciae etc,
will be found.)

24. in minore negotio] Neyotium is often used by ὅππῃ
cp. J. 6. 2 Micipsa...vehementer eo ‘negotio permotus (the grow-
ing importaneeof Jugurtha); J. 58. 7 infecto neyotio; J. 107. 6
ea res uti in tali neqotio probata. ’

’ neglegens] Jordan reads in the same way J. 40. 1, περι,
leyisset (though P has mylae-isset), Or. Lep. 23 intellegerint
(V intellegerent), J. 6.> 2 intelleyit (ἲ present). S. often uses
the other form of the perfect of intellego, but that is not
against this reading. It is strange, however, that no gramff
marian notiees these old forms. ¹ ’ ·

25. tempus dies] tempus, time with its inevitable changes
of circumstances„ dies, time in its inevitable advance. Livy}
also puts the words together 2. 45. 2 diem tempusque forsita
ipsum leniturum iras.

26. ceterum] ‘ but ’‚ not a Ciceronian use.

27. omma mala exempla ex rebus bonis orta sunt. sed
Ex rebus bonis would mean ‘from a prosperous condition o
