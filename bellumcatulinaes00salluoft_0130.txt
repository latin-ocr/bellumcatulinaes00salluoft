68 4 SALLUST'S CATILINE. [11. 3

this clause is meant to be thus connected with the preceding—-
when th¹ is meant an et is used: cp. J. 89. 7 Numidae
plerumqu lacte ac ferina carne vescebantur et neque salem
— neque al a inritamenta yulae quaerebant. Other instances
parallel to the present will be found in C. 11. 3, 58. 1, and
10, J. 24st 3.

4. eis artibus] Artes (‘qua1ities' or ‘means ⁹) is a favouritc
word with Sallust, especially in the phrases bonae artes (virtues),
malae a'rtes (vices). It should be his not eis, says Kvicala‚ for
eis would include the statement that power won by violence
requires violence to maintain it, which is true but not in
Sallust’s mind, while his would confine the reference to the
glood qualities mentioned above. But Sallust is not so deep as
t at.

5.) mvasere] Another favourite word of Sallust's. It is
here ψ’ used absolutely as in 10. 6; J. 41. 9 3 cp. Ter. Hec. 356
an dlolor repente invasit? Liv. 5. 13. 2 dulcedo invasit...plebeios
cre i. Elsewhere in S. it takes an acc„ as in Livy (except
in . 32. 4 and Liv. 28. 29 uec maior in corpus meum vis
morbi quam in vestras mentes invasit). Cicero always uses a
proposition—see incedere 7. 3.

Γ ffortuna] ‘position’. Cp. 51. 13 in maxuma fortuna minuma
mentia est.

· ³6. transfertur] ‘passes’. !

⁴ 7. quae homines arant...v1rtut1 omnia parent] i. e. quae “
homiues ayunt, cum vel arant vel naviyant vel aedificant. ‘In
akriculturffl shipping, building—-everything depends upon ᾗ
ῗΓθτςγᾶ For parent cp. Hor. Sat. 2. 3. 94 omnis euim :¹
fies Virtus sama decus divina humanaque pulchris Divitiis ξ
arent.

f 8.” peregrinantes] The foreigner does not trouble to ac· 1
lquaint himself with the interests of the country, in which he is Α

ἶ only a passing sojourner.

transiere] is more appropriate than transegere (though
the MSS are in its favour) to pereyrinantes, and is sup· =
ported by 1. 1 ue vitam silentio transeant. Some editors how- ,

ever think that with Sallust’s love of variety that passage is ¹

     
 

of construction than of phrase. Ι

amma] It is said that we have anima and not animus
3, here, because the sensual man can only be credited with the
’ anima, which the brutes share with man. That however is
fanciful: cp. 1. 2 sed nostra omnis vis in animo et corpore sita
est with J. 2. 1 uam uti yenus hominum conpositum ex corpore
et anima est e. q. s,
