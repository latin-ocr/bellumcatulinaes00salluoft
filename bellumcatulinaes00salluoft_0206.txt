144 ΒΑΜ UST’S CA TJLJNE. ’ [L1.12·

12. fama. atque fortuna. eorum pares sunt] See note on
20. 2 virtus fidesque. Perhaps the feminine is used here because
fortuna is concrete. (Constans proposes to strike out eorum
(see next line) and to makes. atque f. ablative.)

13. neque studere neque odisse] i. e. without respect of
persons : studere absolutely ‘to show partiality' is rare, and is
perhaps old-fashioned. Cato has it in this sense.

14. 111 imperio] abstract for concrete.

15. paulo saevior] The reading saevior is I think only
just possible—‘if it were a little too—what people would call
‘cruel'’ (ξ 14). Herzog well remarks, that saevior contains a.
logical contradiction to paulo. P has sevior, ancl the omission·
of a middle syllable, when another word is thus produced, ἰοὶ
common enough in that MS, e.g. libertate (liberalitate) suumi
(summum) primum (plurimum) honestas (honestatos) etc.‚ thel
error being sometimes left, sometimes emended by the writer o
corrector. Severior should therefore be read. (It is said that
saevus does not occur in Caesar.)

17. ahena a. re publica] 40. 5 note.

18. nam profecto aut metus ειη-,1111111131 te subegit...genus
poenae novom decernere] The argument is not put as clear
as it might be. There is intended to be a strong emphasis o
novom it seems, ‘For it is an unprecedented punishmen
which only alarm or indignation can account for your pro
posing'. De timore takes up the metus, and de poena th
iniuria. There is no place for alarm, and no punishmen
certainly not death—is proportionate to the offence.

    
     
  
   
    
   
  

20. Something of this kind was certainly said by Caesar
Cic. in Cat. 4. 4. 7 seems to endorse the view of the chie
pontiff. Indeed, when not philosophizing‚ Cicero adopted o
ridiculed the popular belief as suited his purpose. Cp. p. Cl
