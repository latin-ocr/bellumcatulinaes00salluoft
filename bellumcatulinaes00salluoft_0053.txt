‚ That the MSS. of the two first classes come (as has

been shown for other authors) more or less directly
from one and the same manuscript is almost certain.
The following is a neat indication of this. In J. 103. 2,
‚⁸ line or two before the big lacuna, the· mass of the
gnanuscripts have a senseless feliciter (which is altered

{in some to a hardly more satisfactory flectitur). Ae-
·rding to Kortte's certain conjecture, it is a gloss,
⁴= · ut by the writer or reader of the original manuscript,
. ho thus expressed his satisfaction at the turn things
-. erc then taking for the Romans, or, more probably,
solemuly noted the conclusion under the cir-
< ,ιι ιι nces of the work. (Op. the title of the Oratio
ο· ad Caesarem...de republica incip. filicic.’)
β From what source the missing chapters were
v} ,- pued in the MSS. of the second class it is im-
· ‘ble to decide. The loss of them cannot have
’ ι ppened at avery early time, for a grammarian of the
*th century quotes from them : they appear again in
ι “ . of the llth century. The MSS. which contain
«ι ·- ιι haud them down to us in so peculiarly corrupt
state, and with so many variants, that, if they were

· ·p1ied by the recovery of the lost sheets of thev
4 'ginal MS.. these particular sheets must have been
’ 'tten in some very illegible way or have been much

mjured. It is more likely that another, a very ill-
Ι· ‹qn-itum and corrupt but complete MS. came to light
,ᾧ the llth century, and that the writers οἱ the inter-
