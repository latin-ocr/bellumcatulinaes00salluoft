146 SALL USTJS CATILINE. [Β. 4”.

it was 'a proposal for 'adjoumment; and is ‘it n'ot more probable
that he should urge his amendment on the ground that s‘ufq
ficient measures had not yet been taken sor the public safety,
than on the ground that the senate was being overawed by
Cicero's equites? If he took the former line he would be likely
to meet with support (Cic. in Cat. 4. ¹7. 14 iaciuntur enim
voces, quae perveniunt ad aures meas, eorum qui vereri vi·
dentur, ‘ne ‘non habeam satis praesidii ad ea quae vos statueritis
hodierno die transiyunda). But to have objected to Cicero’s
guards would have been to do what Caesar even ventured only
to insinuate very delica'tely (51. 19 and 36), and would surely
have left him no supportem—least of all Silanus. Nero seems
to have spoken after Cicero and before Cato. Cicero says (in
Cat. 4. 4. 7) video adhuc duas esse sententias, unam D. Silani
...alteram Ο. Caesaris. Cicero did little to shake the im·
pression which Caesar had made, and the consul's friends were ,
inclined so far, for Cicero’s own sake, to vote against death. ³
It is probable, then, that Nero made himself the mouthpiece j
of the murmurs which reached Oicero's ears. After Cato's
speech, on the other hand, such a proposal would not have
found a hearing3 and if Nero (who waS‚ by the way, grand-
father of the emperor Tiberius) was, as Willems assumes,
praetorius, he would of course have precedenee of Cato, who
was tribune designate.

5. caesar, ubl ad eum ventum est] It has been said that
the consul-designate was called upon before the consulares. It*
is probable that the same custom obtained with regard to the
other ranks, that Caesar therefore who was now praetor·
designate was called upon before the praetorii (e.g. Nero), and·
thzsst Cato who was tribune (pl.) designate had precedence of· =

patres conscripti] S. makes Adherbal begin his speech
to the senate thus (J. 14. 1) Patres conscripti, Micipsa pater
meus ς. q. s. In the wrong position he gives to P. c. he
shows a foreigner's ignorance of Roman usage. [The title is
generally understood as Livy explains it (2. 1. 11) patres et con-
scripti, the conscripti being plebeians. But it appears doubtful«-
whether the title P. c. was not of earlier origin, and in use
before the plebeian members were enrolled. Ihne explains it
‘patricians enrolled on the senate list' (the album senatorium),
in distinction to the whole body of patricians: and Willems,v
taking patres=senatores (see G. 6. 6), ‘the enrolled fathers,²
though there were no patres that were not conscripta]
